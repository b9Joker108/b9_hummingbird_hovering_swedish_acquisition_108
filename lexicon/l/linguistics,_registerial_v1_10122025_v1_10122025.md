# Registerial Linguistics #

Registerial linguistics studies how language changes based on the situation, purpose, audience and context of a communication event. For example, people use different words, pronunciation and sentence construction and grammar, and styles (registers), in different communicative contexts.  Registerial Linguistics is the study of these "functional varieties" of language, encompassing formal (legal-, scientific-, political-registers, etc.) to informal (casual chat and intimate talk registers, etc.), and how speakers, writers or other communicative code contexts, adapt their speech, writing or communicative codology, to match the specific context, involving aspects like specialized vocabulary and sentence structure, amongst other factors.

**Key Concepts**
* Context-Dependent: A speaker shifts registers depending on the environment (e.g., workplace, home, public speech).
* Formality Spectrum: Registers exist on a continuum from highly formal (e.g., legal jargon, academic writing) to very informal (e.g., slang, intimate terms).
* Features of Registers: Changes can involve:
* Lexicon: Choosing "father" vs. "dad," "child" vs. "kid".
* Grammar/Syntax: Using complex sentences in formal settings, or contractions in casual ones.
* Pronunciation: Saying "-ing" (walking) vs. "-in'" (walkin').
* Registerial Cartography: A field within linguistics that maps and characterizes these registers across different institutions and activities (like hospital emergency rooms or school subjects).
* Registerial Adaptation/Innovation: How individuals change their language (adapt to formality or introduce new styles) over time or in response to social pressures.

**Examples of Registers**
* Formal: Job interviews, academic papers, courtroom proceedings.
* Informal/Casual: Talking with friends, text messages.
* Intimate: Language between very close family or partners ("my love," "sweetie").
* Technical/Professional: Medical, legal, or scientific jargon.
